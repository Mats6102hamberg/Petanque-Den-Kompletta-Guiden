            <p class="quote">A boule court of your own in the garden is the dream of many pétanque players. With proper planning and materials, you can create a playing surface that will last for many years and provide endless hours of playing enjoyment.</p>

            <h2>Planning and Preparation</h2>

            <h3>Choose the Right Location</h3>
            <p>Before you start digging, think carefully about the placement:</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Placement Checklist:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Size:</strong> At least 12 × 3 meters for a standard court (preferably 15 × 4 m if you have space)</li>
                    <li><strong>Clear area around:</strong> At least 50 cm extra on each side for standing and moving</li>
                    <li><strong>Slope:</strong> The ground should be relatively level – a slight slope (1-2%) for drainage is good</li>
                    <li><strong>Sun/shade:</strong> Partial shade is ideal – full sun makes the court hot and dries it out quickly</li>
                    <li><strong>Distance to house:</strong> Remember that boules bounce – keep distance from windows and delicate surfaces</li>
                    <li><strong>Water drainage:</strong> Avoid low points where water collects</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Dimensions and Measurements</h3>

            <h2>Materials You Need</h2>

            <h3>For a 15 × 4 Meter Court</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Base Materials:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Landscape fabric (geotextile):</strong> 70-80 m² – prevents weeds and stabilizes</li>
                    <li><strong>Base layer (crushed stone 0-32 mm):</strong> approx. 6-8 m³ (10-12 cm thickness)</li>
                    <li><strong>Sub-base layer (stone dust 0-8 mm):</strong> approx. 3-4 m³ (5-6 cm thickness)</li>
                    <li><strong>Surface layer (boule gravel 0-4 mm):</strong> approx. 2-3 m³ (3-5 cm thickness)</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Edging Materials (optional but recommended):</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Wooden border:</strong> Pressure-treated planks 50 × 150 mm, approx. 40 linear meters</li>
                    <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> Curbstone, concrete edging, or steel edging</li>
                    <li><strong>Posts:</strong> 45 × 45 mm posts to secure the border, approx. 16-20 pieces</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Tools:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Spade and excavator (or a lot of patience)</li>
                    <li>Spirit level and string line</li>
                    <li>Plate compactor (can be rented)</li>
                    <li>Rake and leveling tool</li>
                    <li>Wheelbarrow</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Building the Court Step by Step</h2>

            <h3>Step 1: Mark Out and Excavate</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <ol>
                    <li>Mark the outer edges of the court with stakes and string</li>
                    <li>Check that the corners are square (measure the diagonals – they should be equal)</li>
                    <li>Excavate 20-25 cm deep within the marked area</li>
                    <li>Create a slight slope (1-2%) in one direction for water drainage</li>
                    <li>Compact the bottom thoroughly with a plate compactor or hand tamper</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h3>Step 2: Lay Landscape Fabric</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <p>The landscape fabric is important to prevent weeds from growing through the gravel and to prevent the layers from mixing with the underlying soil.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lay out the landscape fabric over the entire excavated area</li>
                    <li>Let the fabric extend up along the edges (it can be folded in later)</li>
                    <li>Overlap sheets by at least 20 cm</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Step 3: Base Layer (Crushed Stone)</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <ol>
                    <li>Fill with 10-12 cm of crushed stone (0-32 mm)</li>
                    <li>Spread evenly with a rake</li>
                    <li>Compact thoroughly with a plate compactor – go over it several times</li>
                    <li>Check that the surface is level and has the correct slope</li>
                    <li>Water lightly and compact again for best results</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> This layer is the foundation – take time to do it properly. A good foundation creates a court that will last for many years.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Step 4: Sub-base Layer (Stone Dust)</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <ol>
                    <li>Add 5-6 cm of stone dust (0-8 mm)</li>
                    <li>Spread evenly and level with a rake and straightedge</li>
                    <li>Compact with a plate compactor</li>
                    <li>Water and compact again</li>
                    <li>Allow to settle for a few days before the next step</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h3>Step 5: Install the Border (if chosen)</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Wooden Border:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Drive posts along the edges of the court (approx. 1.5 m apart)</li>
                    <li>Attach the planks to the inside of the posts</li>
                    <li>Check that the border is level and vertical</li>
                    <li>The border should extend approx. 5-8 cm above the finished surface</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Alternative:</strong> Buried curbstones or steel edging give a cleaner appearance.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Step 6: Surface Layer (Boule Gravel)</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <ol>
                    <li>Add 3-5 cm of boule gravel (0-4 mm, preferably crusite limestone or granite gravel)</li>
                    <li>Spread evenly with a rake</li>
                    <li>Compact <strong>lightly</strong> – the surface layer should not become too hard</li>
                    <li>Water gently and allow to settle</li>
                    <li>Adjust any unevenness after a few days of play</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> The surface layer should be firm enough to walk on but give slightly when the boule lands. Too hard = the boule bounces too much. Too soft = the boule "dies" and doesn't roll.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Choosing the Right Gravel</h2>

            <h3>The Surface Layer is Crucial</h3>
            <p>The quality of play depends largely on the surface layer. Here are the most common options:</p>

            <table>

                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Granite Gravel 0-4 mm</strong></td>
                    <td>Gray/reddish, hard</td>
                    <td>Very durable, drains well</td>
                    <td>Doesn't bind as well, may roll more</td>

                    <td>Requires more maintenance, tracks easily</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Recommendation</h4>
                <p>For most home courts, <strong>crushed limestone 0-4 mm</strong> is the best choice. It provides an authentic playing feel, binds well when watered, and is relatively inexpensive. Available at most building supply stores and gravel pits.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Court Maintenance</h2>

            <h3>Regular Maintenance</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>After Each Game:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Level out holes and unevenness with a rake</li>
                    <li>Spread the gravel evenly across the surface</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Every Week (with regular play):</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rake the entire court thoroughly</li>
                    <li>Water if dry – a moist surface plays better</li>
                    <li>Remove leaves and debris</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Every Season:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Top up with new surface gravel where needed (normally 0.5-1 m³ per year)</li>
                    <li>Check the border for rot or damage</li>
                    <li>Clear any weeds along the edges</li>

                <h4>Tips from Experienced Court Builders</h4>
                <p><em>"The best advice I can give is not to rush. Let each layer settle properly before moving on. A court built over a weekend will need a lot of adjustment in the first year. A court built over a month with proper compaction and settling between each step will play perfectly right away."</em></p>
