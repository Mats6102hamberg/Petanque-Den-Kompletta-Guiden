        <div class="content">
            <h2>Manufacturing</h2>
            <p>Pétanque is always played with metal balls. FIPJP's official rules require that balls are hollow and do not contain lead, sand, mercury or other foreign materials. They must also bear the manufacturer's name and weight and meet size and weight requirements.</p>
            
            <h3>Carbon Steel (acier carbon)</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Advantages:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Porous surface, good grip:</strong> Carbon steel balls have a slightly rougher surface that provides better grip and more friction against the ground</li>
                    <li><strong>Popular among pros:</strong> Professionals prefer carbon steel because the slight surface roughness gives better control</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rusts more easily:</strong> The porous surface makes them more sensitive to rust</li>
                    <li><strong>Requires maintenance:</strong> Balls should be dried after play and oiled</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Stainless Steel (inox)</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Advantages:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Smoother surface:</strong> Gives less friction and makes it easier to release the ball quickly in shots</li>
                    <li><strong>Almost maintenance-free:</strong> Stainless steel doesn't rust and requires less care</li>
                    <li><strong>Perfect for beginners:</strong> Easy to keep clean, durable and maintains appearance</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gives slightly less feel in hand compared to carbon steel balls</li>
                    <li>Doesn't stop as easily on hard surfaces</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Size and Weight</h2>
            <p>Official boules must have a diameter between <strong>70.5 and 80 mm</strong> and weigh <strong>650–800 grams</strong>. For children under 11 years, smaller balls of 65 mm and 600 g are allowed.</p>
            
            <h3>Lighter Balls (650–700 g)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Easier to control</li>
                <li>Less weight makes it easier to throw softly</li>
                <li>Gentler on hand and wrist</li>
                <li>Suitable for beginners and players with less hand strength</li>
                <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Less hitting power in shots</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Heavier Balls (720–800 g)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>More stable pointing – rolls less and stops faster</li>
                <li>More power – gives more energy transfer in shots</li>
                <li>Can move opponent's balls further</li>
                <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Requires more strength and good technique</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Diameter and Hand Size</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pointers:</strong> Slightly smaller balls (71–73 mm)</li>
                    <li><strong>Shooters:</strong> Slightly larger (73–76 mm) to reduce target profile</li>
                    <li><strong>Standard for most:</strong> 73 mm and 680 g</li>
                    <li><strong>Small-handed players:</strong> 70.5 mm</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Hardness and Surface Texture</h2>
            <p>Ball "hardness" describes how much it bounces (elasticity) and how resistant it is to scratches. Manufacturers use different designations, but the most common categories are <strong>tendre</strong> (soft), <strong>demi-tendre</strong> (semi-soft) and <strong>dure</strong> (hard).</p>
            
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Hardness Category</th>

                    <td><strong>Soft (tendre)</strong></td>
                    <td>Low bounce, absorbs collisions, "dies" quickly</td>
                    <td>Pointing on asphalt, lob shots, carreau. Good control on hard surfaces.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Semi-soft (demi-tendre)</strong></td>
                    <td>Balanced bounce, good durability</td>
                    <td>All-round play – both pointing and shooting. Suits most players.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Hard (dure)</strong></td>
                    <td>High bounce, rolls longer, very durable</td>
                    <td>Pointing on soft surfaces (sand, gravel). Resistant to scratches.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            
            <h3>Soft Balls</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Low bounce:</strong> Absorbs collisions and "dies" quickly on hard ground</li>
                <li><strong>Ideal for shooters:</strong> Softness reduces rebound and increases chance of carreau</li>
                <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Gets scratches more easily and wears faster</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Hard Balls</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High bounce:</strong> Rolls longer after landing</li>
                <li><strong>Very durable:</strong> Resists scratches and maintains appearance longer</li>
                <li><strong>Ideal for pointers on soft surfaces:</strong> Rolls well on sand and gravel</li>
                <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Can bounce unpredictably on hard surfaces</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Choosing the Right Balls</h2>
            
            <h3>Pointing Balls</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <ul>
                    <li>Lighter and smaller (680–700 g, 71–73 mm)</li>
                    <li>Soft or semi-soft hardness for better control</li>
                    <li>Smaller diameter gives better feel</li>
                    <li>Striated surface for better grip</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Obut "RCC" (carbon steel, soft), La Boule Bleue "Compétition" (semi-soft), MS Pétanque "Classic" (tendre)</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Shooting Balls</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <ul>
                    <li>Lighter and softer (680–690 g)</li>
                    <li>Soft or very soft hardness minimizes bounce</li>
