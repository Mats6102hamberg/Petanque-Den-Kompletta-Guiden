        <div class="content">
            <h2>Weight, Size and Material – What Suits You?</h2>
            <p>In official competition, pétanque boules must be hollow metal balls with a diameter between <strong>70.5 and 80 mm</strong> and a weight between <strong>650 and 800 grams</strong>.</p>

            <p>However, choosing your boules is not just about rules — it is about how they feel in your hand, match your playing style, and suit your role in the team. The right boule can significantly improve your precision, confidence, and enjoyment of the game.</p>

            <h3>Hand Size</h3>
            <p>Your hand size plays a major role in selecting the correct diameter:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you have a <strong>smaller hand</strong>, a boule around <strong>71–73 mm</strong> is usually most comfortable.</li>
                <li>If you have a <strong>larger hand</strong>, you will likely prefer <strong>74–78 mm</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A good rule of thumb is this:<br>
            👉 You should be able to grip the boule firmly without straining your fingers or losing control. It should feel like an extension of your hand, not a burden.</p>

            <h3>Weight</h3>
            <p>The weight of your boules affects how they travel through the air, how they react on different surfaces, and how much strength you need to throw them.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Lighter boules (650–690 g):</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Offer better control and require less physical effort</li>
                    <li>Are ideal for pointers (players who focus on placing balls close to the jack)</li>
                    <li>Are easier for beginners to handle and master</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Heavier boules (710–800 g):</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hold their line better when shooting</li>
                    <li>Require more strength and stability</li>
                    <li>Provide more power when knocking away opponent's balls</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>Many experienced players prefer slightly heavier boules for shooting and lighter ones for pointing — but this is ultimately a personal choice.</p>

            <h3>Hardness</h3>
            <p>Boules come in different levels of hardness:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Harder boules ("carbone")</strong> tend to bounce and roll more. They are generally preferred by shooters, as they travel straighter and resist deformation on impact.</li>
                <li><strong>Softer boules</strong> absorb impact and stop more quickly. They are excellent for pointers, especially on hard or uneven terrain.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A balanced set — neither too hard nor too soft — is often a great starting point for developing players.</p>

            <h2>The Difference Between Competition and Recreational Boules</h2>
            <p>Not all boules are made for the same purpose. Understanding the difference will save you money and frustration.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Recreational Boules</h4>
                <p>These are designed for casual play, parks, beaches, and family games. They typically:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Are filled with sand or gravel</li>
                    <li>Have a chrome-plated surface</li>
                    <li>Come in only one standard size and weight</li>
                    <li>Are inexpensive</li>
                    <li>Do not meet competition standards</li>
                </ul>
                <p>They are perfect for trying the game, but they lack precision, balance, and durability.</p>

                <h4>Competition Boules</h4>
                <p>These are precision-crafted sporting tools. They:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Are hollow and carefully machined</li>
                    <li>Fully comply with FIPJP specifications</li>
                    <li>Are available in many combinations of diameter, weight, hardness, and groove patterns</li>
                    <li>Are more expensive — but offer superior balance, control, and longevity</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A well-chosen competition boule can last many years and become deeply familiar in your hand, almost like a trusted instrument.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>A Sensible Advice for Beginners</h3>
            <p>If you are new to pétanque, it is perfectly reasonable to start with a cheaper recreational set. But once you feel that the game "clicks" for you, invest in proper competition boules.</p>

            <p>A boule that truly fits your hand will give you better accuracy, better feel, and more confidence on the court.</p>

            <p>Special junior sizes are available for children, making the sport accessible from a young age.</p>

            <h2>Maintenance and Cleaning of Boules</h2>
            <p>Metal boules can rust if they are not cared for. Good maintenance is simple — and essential.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>After Each Game: Basic Routine</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Wash</strong> the boules with warm water and a little dish soap to remove dust and dirt. Dry them thoroughly with a clean cloth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lightly oil</strong> them using an oiled cloth or maintenance spray. This creates a thin protective layer that prevents oxidation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Store</strong> them in a dry place inside a suitable bag or box. Avoid damp basements or humid environments.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h3>If Rust Appears</h3>
            <p>If your boules begin to rust, do not panic. You can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Scrub them gently with a steel brush, or</li>
                <li>Let them soak in white wine vinegar, which dissolves rust naturally.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Afterwards, rinse, dry, and oil them again for protection.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Important to Remember</h4>
                <p>With regular care, your boules can last for many years. Treat them well — and they will serve you faithfully on the court.</p>
