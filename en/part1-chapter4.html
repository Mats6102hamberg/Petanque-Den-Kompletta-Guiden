            <h2>Simple Tactics to Win Points</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Boule in Front of the Jack</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>The first ball should almost always be placed <strong>in front of the jack, preferably 30–50 cm in front</strong>. The opponent must then aim to the side of your boule, and if they hit your boule they may push it closer to the jack – double win!</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>2. Use Backstops</h3>
            <p>If there is an opponent's or your own boule behind the jack, you can throw a bit harder so your ball stops against the back boule. A ball lying against a backstop is difficult to shoot away because the force is transferred to the backstop.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Promote Your Boules</h3>
            <p>If your boules are in front of the jack, you can shoot at them in later throws to nudge them closer to the jack. Be careful not to nudge an opponent's boule instead.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Limit the Damage</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <p>If the opponent has placed a perfect ball and you can't get closer, you can place your boules close to their ball. This reduces their opportunities to win more points. Better to lose with 1–2 points than give away 4–5!</p>
                
                <p>If they only need one point to win, you can consider shooting out the jack or playing hard to shoot it toward your balls.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>To Shoot or Point?</h3>
            <p>Follow the basic rule: <strong>shoot when you must and point when you can</strong>. Force the opponent to use their shots so your good placements remain. If their ball is very close to the jack and a shot is the only realistic chance, take the shot. But if the situation is even, place a boule that blocks the line.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">

            <h2>How to Read the Terrain and Adapt</h2>
            <p>The surface affects the ball's roll and bounce. It's important to carefully study the court before you throw – both with your eyes and by feeling the ground:</p>
            
            <h3>Examine the Surface</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Look for holes, stones and slopes</li>
                <li>A soft, sandy surface brakes the ball quickly</li>
                <li>A hard, packed surface gives roll</li>
                <li>A slope can make the ball drift to one side</li>
                <li>Watch how previous balls have behaved</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Adapt Your Throw</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Smooth ground:</strong> You can roll your ball</li>
                    <li><strong>Uneven ground:</strong> You need to lob higher to avoid obstacles</li>
                    <li>Adjust the force so the ball stops at the parking spot</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Vary the Jack Throw</h3>
            <p>Learn to throw the jack both short (6–7 m) and long (9–10 m). Shorter distances often favor pointers, while longer distances favor shooters. If opponents are strong at short throws, you can try longer throws to disrupt their rhythm.</p>
            
            <h3>Play with Weather and Wind</h3>
            <p>Humid weather makes the court softer. Sun and drought make the ground harder and increase roll. Adapt your throws accordingly.</p>
            
            <h2>Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them</h2>
            <p>Beginners often make the same mistakes. Here are some to watch out for:</p>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <h3>1. Aiming Directly at the Jack Instead of the Donnée</h3>
                <p>By choosing a landing point in front of the jack, you can control both length and roll.</p>
                
                <h3>2. Excessive Force or Too Short Throw</h3>
                <p>Many throw too hard when they get nervous and the ball rolls far away. Focus on a soft release and practice varying the force.</p>
                
                <h3>3. Poor Concentration on the Surface</h3>
                <p>Not reading the court leads to unexpected bounces and misses. Take time to study the terrain before each throw.</p>
                
                <h3>4. Too Tight Grip</h3>
                <p>A relaxed grip gives the right signal to the hand. A too tight grip gives security before the throw, but when throwing the hand should be soft and sensitive. Practice holding the ball relaxed and letting the wrist give backspin.</p>
                
                <h3>5. Disturbing the Opponent</h3>
                <p>Talking or moving when someone is throwing. Good etiquette means standing still and quiet when the opponent throws; don't disturb and don't walk between players and the jack's line. It's also important to wait to remove boules until both teams agree on the points.</p>
                
                <h3>6. Not Communicating in the Team</h3>
                <p>Discuss the strategy with your teammates before each throw. A common plan increases the chances of choosing the right tactics.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>By being aware of these mistakes and working on basic techniques, you'll quickly get better results and more enjoyment from the game.</p>
