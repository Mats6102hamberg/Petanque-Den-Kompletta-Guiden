            <h3>Advanced Placement Techniques</h3>
            <p>An effective method for advanced training is to create obstacles. Place three balls around the jack so that it's invisible, and practice placing your ball as close as possible without having to shoot. This forces you to find new landing zones (donn√©es) and develop a heightened sensitivity for backspin.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Training Exercise:</h4>
                <p>Place bricks or balls in a circle around the previous position and practice lobbing over the obstacle to make the ball stop near the jack. By varying the distance between 6 and 10 meters and gradually moving the obstacles, you work on precision at different distances.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Three Types of Pointing Throws</h3>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Throw Type</th>
                    <th>Use</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Rolling</strong></td>
                    <td>For smooth surfaces - the ball rolls on a flat trajectory</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Half-lob</strong></td>
                    <td>For medium-distance throws on varied terrain</td>

                <tr>
                    <td><strong>High lob</strong></td>
                    <td>For long throws on difficult terrain - the ball lands softly</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            
            <h3>Adapting Your Throw to Surface and Weather</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Soft gravel court:</strong> The ball sinks and stops quickly; a flat roll is often safest here</li>
                <li><strong>Hard or rocky court:</strong> The ball bounces easily and can deflect; opt for a high lob with backspin</li>
                <li><strong>Sloped court:</strong> Throw the ball uphill to prevent it from rolling too far</li>
                <li><strong>Rain:</strong> The ground becomes heavier and balls stop faster</li>
                <li><strong>Dry weather:</strong> Increases bounce</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Mental Training ‚Äì Focus and Routines</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <p>At elite level, mental strength is often decisive. Set concrete training goals for each season and each session to maintain your focus.</p>
                
                <h4>Before throwing:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Take a few deep breaths</li>
                    <li>Visualize the throw's trajectory</li>
                    <li>See the ball land where you want it</li>
                    <li>"Turn off" conscious control during the throw itself</li>

            <h2>Training Sessions for Advanced Pointing</h2>
            <p>To take your pointing to the next level, you need to train with precision and measurable goals:</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Exercise 1: The Obstacle Challenge</h4>
                <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Place 3-6 balls or bricks around the jack so it's not directly visible. Practice lobbing over the obstacles and landing near the jack.</p>
                <p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Intermediate:</strong> 4/10 throws within 50 cm of the jack</li>
                    <li><strong>Advanced:</strong> 6/10 throws within 30 cm of the jack</li>
                    <li><strong>Expert:</strong> 3/10 throws closer than all obstacles</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Log:</strong> Number of hits, which throw trajectory (low/medium/high) worked best</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Exercise 2: Different Surfaces - Adaptability</h4>
                <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Train on 3 different surfaces the same day (e.g. gravel, asphalt, grass). Throw 10 balls per surface.</p>
                <p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify which throw type (roll/half-lob/high lob) works best per surface</li>
                    <li>Hit within 50 cm: at least 5/10 on each surface</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Log:</strong> Surface, best throw type, hit percentage, what needs adjustment</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Exercise 3: Backspin Control</h4>
                <p><strong>Setup:</strong> On hard surface, throw 10 balls focusing on maximum backspin. Measure how far the ball rolls after landing.</p>
                <p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Intermediate:</strong> Ball rolls <1 meter after landing on a 7m throw</li>
                    <li><strong>Advanced:</strong> Ball rolls <50 cm after landing</li>
                    <li><strong>Expert:</strong> Ball "dies" within 30 cm of landing point</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Log:</strong> Roll distance per throw, wrist technique that worked best</p>
