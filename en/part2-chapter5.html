            <p class="quote">Once you've passed the beginner stage, pétanque is no longer just about placing a ball near the jack, but about solving difficult situations and mastering advanced techniques.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 5 – Improve Your Pointing</h2>

            <h3>Advanced Placement Techniques</h3>
            <p>At an advanced level, pointing is as much about creativity as precision. A powerful way to train this is to create artificial obstacles.</p>

            <p>Place three boules around the jack so that it is partly hidden from your view. Your task is to place your boule as close as possible without shooting.</p>

            <p>This forces you to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>discover new landing zones (données),</li>
                <li>refine your sense of height and distance,</li>
                <li>and develop a more sensitive use of backspin.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You learn not just to "hit a spot," but to shape the flight and roll of your boule.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Training Exercise – Obstacle Play</h4>
                <p>Place bricks, cones, or boules in a small circle around the previous position of the jack.</p>
                <p>Practice lobbing over the obstacle and letting the boule stop softly near the jack.</p>
                <p>Vary the distance between 6 and 10 meters, and gradually move the obstacles closer together. Over time, you will notice that your precision improves at all distances — not only your favorite ones.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Three Types of Pointing Throws</h3>
            <p>At a higher level, you should be comfortable with three main trajectories:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Throw Type</th>
                    <th>When to Use</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Rolling throw</strong></td>
                    <td>Best on smooth surfaces — the boule travels low and straight along the ground.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Half-lob</strong></td>
                    <td>Most versatile throw for medium distances and mixed terrain.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>High lob</strong></td>
                    <td>Ideal for long throws or very difficult ground — the boule lands softly and stops quickly.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>A top player does not choose randomly — they select the trajectory that best fits both the terrain and the tactical situation.</p>

            <h3>Adapting Your Throw to Surface and Weather</h3>
            <p>The court is never neutral. Your success depends on how well you adjust.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Soft gravel court:</strong> The boule sinks and stops quickly — a flat, rolling throw is often safest.</li>
                <li><strong>Hard or rocky court:</strong> The boule tends to bounce unpredictably — use a higher lob with clear backspin.</li>
                <li><strong>Sloped court:</strong> Throw slightly uphill to prevent the boule from rolling too far.</li>
                <li><strong>Rain:</strong> The ground becomes heavier and boules stop faster.</li>
                <li><strong>Dry weather:</strong> The ground becomes harder, increasing bounce and roll.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A great pointer adapts instinctively — but this instinct is built through experience.</p>

            <h3>Mental Training – Focus and Routines</h3>
            <p>At elite level, mental strength is often what decides matches. Technique gets you to the circle — mindset determines what happens inside it.</p>

            <p>Set clear training goals for each season and each session to keep your focus sharp.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Before every throw:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Take a few slow, deep breaths.</li>
                    <li>Visualize the trajectory of your boule.</li>
                    <li>Imagine exactly where you want it to land.</li>
                    <li>Once you start the movement — "turn off" conscious control and trust your body.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This balance between concentration and relaxation is one of the hallmarks of top players.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Training Sessions for Advanced Pointing</h2>
            <p>To progress beyond a good club level, your practice must be structured and measurable.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Exercise 1 – The Obstacle Challenge</h4>
                <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Place 3–6 boules or bricks around the jack so it is not directly visible. Practice lobbing over the obstacles and landing close to the jack.</p>
                <p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Intermediate:</strong> 4/10 throws within 50 cm</li>
                    <li><strong>Advanced:</strong> 6/10 within 30 cm</li>
                    <li><strong>Expert:</strong> 3/10 throws closer than all obstacles</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Log:</strong> Record number of hits and which trajectory (low/medium/high) worked best.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Exercise 2 – Different Surfaces: Adaptability</h4>
                <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Train on three different surfaces in the same session (for example gravel, asphalt, and grass). Throw 10 boules on each surface.</p>
                <p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify which throw type works best per surface.</li>
                    <li>Hit within 50 cm at least 5/10 times on each surface.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Log:</strong> Note surface, best trajectory, hit percentage, and what needed adjustment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Exercise 3 – Backspin Control</h4>
                <p><strong>Setup:</strong> On a hard surface, throw 10 boules focusing on maximum backspin. Measure how far each boule rolls after landing.</p>
                <p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Intermediate:</strong> boule rolls less than 1 meter after landing on a 7 m throw.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advanced:</strong> less than 50 cm roll.</li>
                    <li><strong>Expert:</strong> boule "dies" within 30 cm of landing point.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Log:</strong> Record roll distance and which wrist technique worked best.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Training Tip</h4>
                <p>Train 2–3 times per week for 30–45 minutes. Keep a simple journal — after four weeks your progress will be unmistakable.</p>
