            <h2>Direct Hits vs. Rolling Shots</h2>
            <p>A championship shooter masters several types of shots. An <strong>"au fer shot"</strong> is a direct hit where your ball strikes the opponent's ball dead center; the goal is often to make a <em>carreau</em>, i.e., your ball takes the opponent's place and stays there.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Different Shot Types According to Obut:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Direct Shot:</strong> Knocks away the opponent's ball straight from the front</li>
                    <li><strong>Rolling Shot:</strong> The ball is sent with force along the ground</li>
                    <li><strong>Shot on the Jack:</strong> To kill the end</li>
                    <li><strong>Shot in Front of Boule:</strong> The ball lands just in front of the opponent's and rolls in</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>When Should You Choose a Direct Shot?</h3>
            <p>Choose a direct shot when the terrain is uneven or when you need a reliable result – a bouncing ball is less affected by the surface.</p>
            
            <h3>When Should You Choose a Rolling Shot?</h3>
            <p>Rolling shots work best on even courts or when you need to shoot several opponent balls in a row, but carry risk of bounces and deviations.</p>
            
            <h2>Training Tips to Become a Skilled Shooter</h2>
            <p>To shoot with power and precision requires technique and momentum. According to experts, the arm should function as a pendulum; think more about generating swing speed than tensing muscles.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>The 6-Boule Challenge:</h4>
                <p>A popular exercise to improve your shooting technique:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place six balls as targets in specific positions</li>
                    <li>Shoot one boule at a time focusing on replacing the target ball</li>
                    <li>After each shot, step out of the circle</li>
                    <li>Visualize the next throw</li>
                    <li>Enter the circle again and shoot</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Repeat the exercise at different distances to improve both power and precision.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Top Tips for Shooting Technique:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Keep fingers together</strong> – gives better control of the ball</li>
                <li><strong>Stand firmly</strong> with leading foot pointing toward the target</li>
                <li><strong>Use the free arm</strong> for balance</li>
                <li><strong>Finish the throw</strong> with hand pointing toward the target</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Additional Training Exercises</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Shooting Gate with Bands:</h4>
                <p>Build a "shooting gate" with two bands at head height where you try to throw the ball between the bands. This technique helps you maintain a consistent throwing path and height.</p>
                
                <h4>Wiffle Ball Training:</h4>
                <p>Use a wiffle ball or plastic ball as a target to create a clear hitting surface and force yourself to throw with controlled height.</p>

            <h2>Analysis of Professional Shooting Styles</h2>
            <p>The best shooters have developed personal yet effective throws. Here are some of the most successful techniques:</p>
            
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Technique</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                    <th>Result</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Elbow Shot</strong></td>
                    <td>The ball is held near the face, the swing is brought back past the hip and then released at a steep angle</td>
                    <td>The ball drops onto the target ball and replaces it – perfect carreau</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Lift and Drop</strong></td>
                    <td>The player lifts the ball to waist height, releases it along the throwing line with short backswing and early release</td>
                    <td>Gives a soft but very precise shot</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Wing Spread</strong></td>
                    <td>A high swinging throw with powerful release where the player uses a large arc</td>
                    <td>Hits the target directly with great force</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Crane School</strong></td>
                    <td>A grip variant where the ball is held further out in the fingers</td>
                    <td>Generates much backspin – suitable when you need more control</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Fold and Roll</strong></td>
                    <td>A slower swing with moderate follow-through</td>
                    <td>Used with heavier balls for controlled shots</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            
            <h3>The Importance of Consistent Height</h3>
            <p>Regardless of technique, professionals strive for consistent height. Analysis shows that world-class shooters almost always throw the ball so the top of the arc is around head height; at longer distances they throw slightly higher.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Training with Framework:</h4>
                <p>By practicing with a framework with two bands – one at head height and one just above – you can train yourself to throw between the bands and get an even trajectory.</p>
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> When shooters focus on the throw's height rather than hitting the target boule, accuracy often increases!</p>
