            <p class="quote">At a high level, pétanque is not just about technical skill – it's about thinking strategically, reading the opponent and controlling the game's tempo.</p>
            
            <h2>Controlling Game Tempo</h2>
            <div class="info-box">
                <p>Tempo in pétanque is about more than just throwing fast. Experienced tacticians use terrain, length and order of throws to control the rhythm.</p>
                
                <h4>Important Principles:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Always discuss</strong> where the jack should be placed before the end begins</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid playing</strong> two balls in a row without first evaluating the situation</li>
                    <li><strong>Vary the distance</strong> between 6 and 10 meters to force the opponent out of their comfort zone</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Control the Game's Rhythm</h3>
            <p>By varying tempo and distance you can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Disrupt the opponent's concentration</li>
                <li>Exploit your strengths and avoid theirs</li>
                <li>Create uncertainty in the opponent</li>
                <li>Maintain initiative in the game</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Psychological Warfare – Reading the Opponent</h2>
            <p>Mental play is an important part of pétanque at a high level. Here are some effective tactics:</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Positioning Tactics:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Place your balls near or in front of</strong> the opponent's boules to force them into difficult shots</li>
                    <li><strong>Play directly behind</strong> or in line with the opponent's balls</li>
                    <li><strong>Block the view</strong> to the jack to make it harder to judge distance</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h4>📋 Advanced Decision Tree: Point or Shoot?</h4>
                <p>At a high level it's about reading the situation and making quick, strategic decisions:</p>
                <table>

                        <td>Block and limit opponent's scoring chances. Avoid risky shots that could give them big points.</td>

                        <td>Opponent has shooter with >70% accuracy</td>
                        <td><strong>POINT close + block</strong></td>
                        <td>Place your balls close to opponent's to make shots risky. Force them to choose between shooting or giving you points.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Last ball in mène + you're 2-3 points behind</td>

                        <td>Continue placing good balls to increase psychological pressure. Force them to make difficult decisions.</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                
                <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Always communicate with the team before deciding. A common strategy is stronger than individual decisions.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Team Play – Communication and Roles</h2>
            
            <h3>The Three Roles in Triples</h3>
            <p>In triples, roles are often divided among three specialists. Each role has its specific responsibility and together they form a strong unit:</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>1. Pointeur (Pointer)</h4>
                <p><strong>Main Task:</strong> To place their ball as close to the jack as possible. This is called "pointing" or "placing" the ball.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Precision, finesse and terrain observation</li>
                    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Create points for the team through accurate placements</li>
                    <li><strong>Usually plays:</strong> First in the end</li>
                    <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Calm, patient and has good feel for surfaces</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>2. Milieu (Middle Player/All-rounder)</h4>
                <p><strong>Main Task:</strong> To be versatile – a player who can do both the pointeur job (placing) and tireur job (shooting).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Adaptability and strategic overview</li>
                    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Act as link between pointeur and tireur and step in where needed most</li>
                    <li><strong>Usually plays:</strong> In the middle of the end</li>
                    <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Flexible, decisive and has good game understanding</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>3. Tireur (Shooter)</h4>
                <p><strong>Main Task:</strong> To shoot (hit) the opponent's balls to knock them away from the jack and thus eliminate their point threat.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Strength, precision and concentration</li>
                    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Clear dangerous opponent balls through accurate shots</li>
                    <li><strong>Usually plays:</strong> Last in the end</li>
                    <li><strong>Specialty:</strong> "Shooting on iron" (tirer au fer) or making a "carreau" (where your own ball stays in place of the knocked-away ball)</li>
                    <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Confident, focused and handles pressure</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Psychological Flexibility – Playing Despite Nervousness</h2>
            <p>Many believe that the key to success in boule is being completely calm and "empty" of troubling thoughts when stepping into the circle. But the truth is different. The best players are not necessarily calmer than you – they are more <strong>psychologically flexible</strong>.</p>

            <p>Psychological flexibility is about the ability to do the right thing, regardless of what you feel or think at the moment. It is built on the interplay between three parts:</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Thoughts</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>"I'm going to miss."</li>
                    <li>"Everything depends on me now."</li>
                    <li>"The surface is hopeless."</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Feelings and Body</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heart pounding.</li>
                    <li>Hands trembling.</li>
                    <li>A knot in the stomach.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Behavior</h4>
                <p>How you actually execute your throw and follow your routine.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Don't Believe Everything Your Brain Says</h3>
            <p>The brain is a survival machine. It's fantastic at creating catastrophe scenarios about the future. When you stand in the circle it might scream: <em>"You're going to miss!"</em></p>
            <p>If you treat that thought as absolute truth, you become stiff, cautious and afraid.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>The achievement in boule is not to silence your thoughts or stop trembling.</strong></p>
                <p>The achievement is to notice the thought, let it be there as background noise, and still follow the plan and decision you made before stepping into the circle.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>The Decision in the Circle</h3>
            <p>When you have decided which line to choose or which ball to shoot, it is the <strong>decision</strong> that controls – not your nervousness.</p>

            <p>Psychological flexibility is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>letting the heart pound</li>
                <li>letting the thoughts chatter</li>
                <li>and still letting the hand perform the movement you have practiced thousands of times</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight-box" style="background: #e8f5e9; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50;">
                <h4>Remember:</h4>
                <p>You don't need to feel confident to throw a perfect ball.</p>
                <p><strong>You just need to be willing to throw it despite being uncertain.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <h2>MGP – Your Mental Checklist for Every Ball</h2>
            <p>In boule it's easy to go on autopilot or let stress take over when stepping into the circle. To eliminate carelessness and uncertainty we use the <strong>MGP method</strong>.</p>
            <p>Before you even set foot in the circle, mentally stop and check off three points. This is your internal control station.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>M – Mathematics 🔢</h4>
                <p>Before the strategy is decided you must know the numbers. <strong>Always count first.</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ball count:</strong> How many balls do you have left? How many do the opponents have?</li>
                    <li><strong>Point situation:</strong> How many points are on the ground right now?</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Basic rule:</strong> Never throw a ball without knowing if you have ball advantage or are at a disadvantage. The mathematics determines what risk level is reasonable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>G – Geography 🌍</h4>
                <p>Now you read the scene in front of you. Geography is about understanding the terrain and ball positions.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Read the game:</strong> Which balls are live and dangerous? Which are in the way?</li>
                    <li><strong>Change perspective:</strong> Always walk up to the jack. Looking only from the circle often gives a false picture of distances.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visualize the landing:</strong> Stand by the jack and look back toward the circle. Assess the height required and look for a smooth, flattened landing point.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>P – The Plan 🎯</h4>
                <p>When the mathematics is calculated and the geography analyzed, it's time to make the decision.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Choose landing point:</strong> Decide exactly where the ball should land and what the goal of the throw is – point, push away or shoot.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The golden rule:</strong> Never change your plan once you're standing in the circle. Hesitation is precision's greatest enemy.</p>
                <p>If you've decided – go for it. <strong>Trust your decision.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <h3>The Team's Responsibility – Creating Peace to Work</h3>
            <p>For MGP to work, teamwork is required. When the thrower steps into the circle, an invisible bubble forms.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Complete silence:</strong> No last-second tips or changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on execution:</strong> All strategy is discussed before the circle. In the circle only execution remains.</li>
                <li><strong>Respect the bubble:</strong> As a teammate, your most important task is to give the thrower mental space to trust their plan.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>💡 Coach's Tip</h4>
                <p>By following the MGP routine you reduce mental load. You don't need to think when you throw – all thinking was done during M, G and P. <strong>In the circle you are just an executor.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <h3>MGP and Psychological Flexibility – How They Work Together</h3>
            <p>The MGP model is not just a tactical tool. It's also a strong aid for mental strength. Together, MGP and psychological flexibility create conditions for performing under pressure.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>1. M and G Give the Brain the Right Focus</h4>
                <p>When the brain starts producing worrying thoughts – <em>"What if I miss"</em>, <em>"Everyone is watching me"</em> – Mathematics and Geography give you something concrete to focus on.</p>
                <p>Instead of getting stuck in inner feelings, attention is directed outward: toward ball count, surface and landing point.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>2. The Plan (P) is Your Anchor</h4>
                <p>Psychological flexibility is about doing what you should, regardless of how it feels.</p>
                <p><strong>The plan is what you hold on to when nervousness makes itself known.</strong> When the heart pounds and doubt creeps in, it's your predetermined plan that controls behavior – not the feeling.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>3. Acting Despite the Noise</h4>
                <p>When you have gone through MGP and stepped into the circle, the brain can still chatter. The difference now is that you don't need to listen.</p>
                <p>You can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>notice the noise</li>
                    <li>accept that nervousness is there</li>
                    <li>and still execute the throw according to plan</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box" style="background: #e3f2fd; border-left: 4px solid #2196f3;">
                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p><strong>MGP</strong> helps you make the wise decision before the circle.</p>
                <p><strong>Psychological flexibility</strong> helps you execute the decision when pressure is at its peak.</p>
                <p><strong>Together they transform uncertainty into controlled action.</strong></p>

            <h3>Communication is Key</h3>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The team's success depends on the pointeur creating points, the tireur destroying the opponent's points and the milieu adapting and supporting both roles.</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <p>To succeed, the team must act as a unit. Communicate clearly before each throw:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Is the goal to win the points?</li>
                    <li>Should we block the opponent?</li>
                    <li>Should we eliminate a dangerous ball?</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Never let two players throw without consulting each other – the game is quickly lost when communication stops.</p>

            <h3>Team Tactics in Practice</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Early in the match:</strong> Establish your playing style and test opponent's weaknesses</li>
                <li><strong>When leading:</strong> Play safely and avoid unnecessary risks</li>
                <li><strong>When behind:</strong> Dare to take risks and try to change the game's dynamics</li>
                <li><strong>At end of match:</strong> Stay calm and follow your game plan</li>
            </ul>
