        <div class="content">
            <p class="quote">At an advanced level, pétanque is no longer only about technique. It becomes a game of strategy, anticipation, emotional control, and the ability to read both the terrain and the opponent.</p>

            <p>Great players do not simply react — they shape the match.</p>

            <h2>Controlling Game Tempo</h2>
            <p>Tempo in pétanque is not about throwing fast or slow. It is about controlling rhythm, distance, and decision-making.</p>

            <p>Experienced tacticians manipulate the tempo by using terrain, jack placement, and order of play to their advantage.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Key principles</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Always discuss jack placement before each end begins.</li>
                    <li>Avoid playing two boules in a row without first evaluating the situation.</li>
                    <li>Vary the distance of the jack between 6 and 10 meters to push opponents out of their comfort zone.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>By changing tempo and distance, you can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>disturb your opponent's concentration,</li>
                <li>highlight your own strengths,</li>
                <li>create uncertainty in the other team,</li>
                <li>and keep the initiative on your side.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Psychological Warfare – Reading the Opponent</h2>
            <p>At high level, mental play is just as important as technical play. Your placement of boules can influence not only the score — but your opponent's state of mind.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Positioning tactics</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Place your boules near or in front of your opponent's boules to force difficult shots.</li>
                    <li>Play directly behind or in line with their boules to create tactical pressure.</li>
                    <li>Block their view of the jack to make distance judgment harder.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This is not about being aggressive — it is about being strategically uncomfortable to play against.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Adapt to Your Opponent</h3>
            <p>Different opponents require different tactics:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Opponent's strength</th>
                    <th>Your tactic</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Prefers short throws</td>
                    <td>Place the jack longer (9–10 m)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Strong shooter</td>
                    <td>Point well and make them use their shots</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Strong pointer</td>
                    <td>Shoot aggressively early in the end</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Prefers even terrain</td>
                    <td>Choose uneven parts of the court</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>A smart team adjusts continuously — not just between matches, but within the same match.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Advanced Decision Tree: Point or Shoot?</h4>
                <p>At elite level, decisions must be fast and precise.</p>
                <table>

                        <td><strong>Shoot aggressively</strong></td>
                        <td>Aim at the boule best positioned to move others</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>You lead 11–12 points</td>
                        <td><strong>Point defensively</strong></td>
                        <td>Avoid risky shots that could give big points</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Opponent has shooter &gt;70% accuracy</td>
                        <td><strong>Point + block</strong></td>
                        <td>Force them to choose between shooting or giving you points</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Last boule in mène and you're 2–3 behind</td>
                        <td><strong>Shoot the jack</strong></td>
                        <td>Move it toward your boules or out of play</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Perfect donnée + good terrain</td>
                        <td><strong>Point for carreau position</strong></td>
                        <td>Place in front of jack: "Boule devant, boule d'argent."</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Opponent looks nervous</td>
                        <td><strong>Point + increase pressure</strong></td>
                        <td>Make them face hard decisions</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>

                <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Always decide as a team. A shared plan is stronger than individual instinct.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Team Play – Communication and Roles</h2>

            <h3>The three roles in triples</h3>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>1. Pointeur (Pointer)</h4>
                <p><strong>Main task:</strong> place boules close to the jack.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Focus:</strong> precision, finesse, terrain reading.</li>
                    <li>Usually plays first in the end.</li>
                    <li><strong>Profile:</strong> calm, patient, perceptive.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>2. Milieu (All-rounder)</h4>
                <p><strong>Main task:</strong> link between pointer and shooter.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Focus:</strong> adaptability and tactical overview.</li>
                    <li>Usually plays in the middle of the end.</li>
                    <li><strong>Profile:</strong> flexible, decisive, game-intelligent.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>3. Tireur (Shooter)</h4>
                <p><strong>Main task:</strong> remove dangerous opponent boules.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Focus:</strong> strength, accuracy, concentration.</li>
                    <li>Usually plays last.</li>
                    <li><strong>Specialty:</strong> tir au fer and carreau.</li>
                    <li><strong>Profile:</strong> confident, composed under pressure.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>A strong team is not three individuals — it is one coordinated unit.</p>

            <h2>Psychological Flexibility – Playing Despite Nervousness</h2>
            <p>Many believe that great players are completely calm. In reality, the best players are not calmer — they are more <strong>psychologically flexible</strong>.</p>

            <p>Psychological flexibility means doing the right thing regardless of what you feel.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Common inner experiences in the circle:</h4>

                <p><strong>Thoughts:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"I'm going to miss."</li>
                    <li>"Everything depends on me."</li>
                    <li>"This surface is terrible."</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Body reactions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Racing heartbeat</li>
                    <li>Shaking hands</li>
                    <li>Tight stomach</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These are normal — and they do not have to control your throw.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Don't Believe Everything Your Brain Says</h3>
            <p>The brain is wired to imagine worst-case scenarios. When you stand in the circle it may shout:</p>
            <p><em>"You're going to miss!"</em></p>
            <p>If you treat that thought as truth, you become stiff and fearful.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>The goal is not to silence your thoughts</strong> — but to notice them, let them be there, and still execute your plan.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>The Decision in the Circle</h3>
            <p>Once you have chosen your line or target, the <strong>decision</strong> leads — not your nerves.</p>

            <p>Psychological flexibility means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>letting your heart pound,</li>
                <li>letting thoughts chatter,</li>
                <li>and still performing the movement you have practiced thousands of times.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight-box" style="background: #e8f5e9; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50;">
                <p>You do not need to feel confident to throw a good boule.</p>
                <p><strong>You only need to be willing to throw despite uncertainty.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <h2>MGP – Your Mental Checklist for Every Ball</h2>
            <p>To avoid stress and impulsive decisions, use the <strong>MGP method</strong> before entering the circle.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>M – Mathematics 🔢</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>How many boules do we have left?</li>
                    <li>How many does the opponent have?</li>
                    <li>How many points are currently on the ground?</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Never throw without knowing the numbers — they determine your risk level.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>G – Geography 🌍</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Which boules are dangerous?</li>
                    <li>Walk up to the jack and look back toward the circle.</li>
                    <li>Visualize the landing point before you move.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>P – The Plan 🎯</h4>
                <p>Choose your exact landing point and purpose:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>point,</li>
                    <li>push,</li>
                    <li>or shoot.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Golden rule:</strong> once you step into the circle — do not change the plan.</p>
                <p>Hesitation is the enemy of precision.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>The Team's Responsibility – Creating Peace to Work</h3>
            <p>For MGP to function, teamwork is essential.</p>
            <p>When a teammate steps into the circle:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>maintain <strong>complete silence</strong>,</li>
                <li>finalize all discussion <strong>before</strong> the circle,</li>
                <li>give the thrower mental space to trust their plan.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Coach's Tip</h4>
                <p>With MGP you think before the circle — inside the circle you are only an executor.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>MGP and Psychological Flexibility – Working Together</h3>
            <p>MGP gives structure. Psychological flexibility gives calm under pressure.</p>

            <p>Together they:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>focus attention outward,</li>
                <li>reduce emotional noise,</li>
                <li>and allow you to act decisively.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight-box" style="background: #e3f2fd; border-left: 4px solid #2196f3;">
                <p>When fear arises, Mathematics and Geography give your brain something concrete to hold onto — and The Plan keeps your behavior steady.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Communication Is Key</h3>
            <p>Team success depends on clear dialogue:</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p>Before each throw ask:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Are we aiming to win points?</li>
                    <li>Should we block?</li>
                    <li>Should we eliminate a dangerous boule?</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Never let two players throw without consulting each other.</strong></p>
                <p>Matches are lost when communication stops.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Team Tactics in Practice</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Early in the match:</strong> establish your style and test weaknesses.</li>
                <li><strong>When leading:</strong> play safe and avoid unnecessary risks.</li>
                <li><strong>When behind:</strong> dare to take calculated risks.</li>
                <li><strong>At the end of the match:</strong> stay calm and stick to your plan.</li>
            </ul>
