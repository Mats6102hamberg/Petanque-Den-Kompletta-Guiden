            <h2>Chapter 10 — Pétanque Around the World</h2>

            <h3>Cultural Differences in the Game</h3>
            <p>Pétanque was born in Provence, France, but spread rapidly with the introduction of modern steel boules. Today, the sport has strong national federations in countries such as Germany, Spain, and England — as well as deep roots in former French colonial regions including Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Puducherry in India.</p>

            <p>While the core rules remain the same, playing styles, etiquette, and traditions vary from country to country, giving pétanque a rich cultural diversity.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Some Numbers (updated wording for clarity)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>France:</strong> Over 300,000 licensed members in the FFPJP.</li>
                    <li><strong>USA:</strong> Approximately 30,000 players; 2,141 members across 52 clubs (2015).</li>
                    <li><strong>FIPJP:</strong> Nearly 800,000 registered members in 2022.</li>
                    <li><strong>Thailand:</strong> Around 80,000 competitive players.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These figures illustrate how pétanque has evolved from a regional pastime to a truly global sport.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Thailand — A Fascinating Example</h3>
            <p>Princess Srinagarindra introduced pétanque to Thailand in the 1970s and encouraged schools, police, military, and civil services to adopt the sport. Today, pétanque is part of official military training, and Thailand ranks among the world's elite nations alongside Vietnam and Laos.</p>

            <p>Bangkok-based manufacturer FBT is one of the few factories outside France producing FIPJP-approved boules — a clear sign of how deeply the sport has taken root in the country.</p>

            <h3>Informal Traditions and Etiquette</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>"Faire fanny"</h4>
                <p>Losing a match 0–13 is traditionally called <em>faire fanny</em>. In some clubs, the losing team buys the winners a drink — and in older French traditions, may even kiss a wooden statue of "Fanny" as a playful ritual. This custom reflects the social and humorous side of the game.</p>
            </div>

            <h4>Good Etiquette Means:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Never walk in front of a player who is about to throw.</li>
                <li>Stand still and remain silent when someone is concentrating.</li>
                <li>Wait until the boule has landed before commenting or celebrating.</li>
                <li>Use proper measuring tools instead of feet.</li>
                <li>Show respect to opponents, spectators, and referees.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>By combining official rule knowledge with good etiquette, you become a respected pétanque player wherever you play.</p>
