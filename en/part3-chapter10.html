            <h2>Chapter 10 ‚Äì P√©tanque Around the World</h2>
            
            <h3>Cultural Differences in the Game</h3>
            <p>P√©tanque was born in Provence but spread quickly thanks to modern "metal balls". Today there are strong national federations in Germany, Spain and England, and the sport is particularly popular in countries with French colonial heritage such as Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Puducherry in India.</p>
