            <p class="quote">Pétanque is more than just a sport — it is a social activity, a cultural tradition, and a global community. Whether played casually among friends or in high-stakes tournaments, the game creates connection, shared experiences, and a sense of belonging that goes far beyond winning or losing.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 9 – Competition vs. Social Play</h2>

            <h3>Differences in Mindset and Strategy</h3>
            <p>In everyday language, the terms social pétanque and competition pétanque are often used to describe two different ways of engaging with the game. Both are valuable, but they demand different mindsets, behaviors, and expectations.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Social Play</h4>
                <p>In friendly games without referees, the spirit of the game is based on cooperation, enjoyment, and mutual respect rather than strict enforcement of rules.</p>
                <p>Typical characteristics of social play include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Games are played without an official referee.</li>
                    <li>If something unclear or irregular happens, players discuss it together and agree on a solution.</li>
                    <li>The atmosphere is relaxed, and social interaction is as important as the score.</li>
                    <li>Players often experiment with new tactics or alternate who throws first.</li>
                    <li>Points are counted, but winning is not the main objective.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Social pétanque is about friendship, laughter, and shared moments — a tradition that keeps the soul of the game alive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Competition Play</h4>
                <p>In contrast, official competition pétanque follows structured rules and procedures designed to ensure fairness and consistency.</p>
                <p>Key aspects of competitive play include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A referee is present and can be called upon in case of disputes.</li>
                    <li>The referee's decision is final and cannot be appealed.</li>
                    <li>Players must respect the official time limit for each throw (typically one minute).</li>
                    <li>Every point matters — matches are often decided by small details.</li>
                    <li>Teams carefully prepare each throw by analyzing the terrain, discussing strategy, and coordinating their roles.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Competition pétanque rewards discipline, concentration, and teamwork under pressure.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>How to Find Clubs and Tournaments</h3>
            <p>Joining a local club is the most effective way to improve your game, meet experienced players, and participate in organized competitions. Most countries have a national pétanque federation that provides information about clubs, leagues, and events.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>In Sweden</h4>
                <p>The Swedish Boule Federation (Svenska Bouleförbundet) is responsible for player licenses, competitions, and national rankings. Their official website offers contact details for local clubs across the country, making it easy for newcomers to get involved.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Internationally</h4>
                <p>For players who want to compete or travel, several international resources are available:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The FIPJP calendar, which lists major international tournaments.</li>
                    <li>The European Pétanque Confederation's EuroCup, a prestigious team event.</li>
                    <li>The Masters de Pétanque, often described as a "Tour de France" of pétanque, held in multiple French cities.</li>
                    <li>Online communities such as Facebook groups and Meetup pages where players organize informal games.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These platforms help connect players worldwide and strengthen the global pétanque community.</p>
