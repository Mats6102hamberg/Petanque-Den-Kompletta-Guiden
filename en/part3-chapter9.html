            <p class="quote">Pétanque is more than a sport – it's a social activity, a cultural tradition and a global community.</p>
            
            <h2>Chapter 9 – Competition vs. Social Play</h2>
            
            <h3>Differences in Mindset and Strategy</h3>
            <p>In practice, the term "social" or "casual" pétanque is used for friendly games without referees, while "competition play" refers to sanctioned tournaments with referees.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Social Play:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Played without umpire (referee)</li>
                    <li>When something irregular happens, teams decide together</li>
                    <li>Atmosphere is relaxed and the goal is socializing</li>
                    <li>Players try new tactics and take turns throwing</li>
                    <li>Points are counted but aren't the most important</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Competition Play:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>There's a referee who is called for irregularities</li>
                    <li>Referee's decision cannot be appealed</li>
                    <li>Maintain tempo and follow one-minute rule for throws</li>
                    <li>Think strategically – every point can decide the match</li>
                    <li>Prepare throw, discuss with teammates, read terrain</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>How to Find Clubs and Tournaments</h3>
            <p>Joining a club is the best way to develop your game. Most countries have a national federation with lists of clubs.</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>In Sweden:</h4>
                <p>Svenska Bouleförbundet is responsible for licenses and competitions. Their website provides contact information for local associations.</p>
                
                <h4>Internationally:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>FIPJP's calendar for international competitions</li>
                    <li>European Pétanque Confederation's EuroCup</li>
                    <li>Masters de Pétanque - a "Tour de France" for world elite</li>
                    <li>Facebook groups and Meetup pages for informal games</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Cultural Differences in the Game</h3>
            <p>Pétanque was born in Provence but spread quickly thanks to modern "metal balls". Today there are strong national federations in Germany, Spain and England, and the sport is particularly popular in countries with French colonial heritage such as Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Puducherry in India.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Some Numbers:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>France:</strong> Over 300,000 licensed members in FFPJP</li>
                    <li><strong>USA:</strong> Around 30,000 players; 2,141 members in 52 clubs (2015)</li>
                    <li><strong>FIPJP:</strong> Nearly 800,000 members in 2022</li>
                    <li><strong>Thailand:</strong> Approximately 80,000 competitive players</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Thailand – A Fascinating Example</h3>
            <p>Princess Srinagarindra introduced pétanque to Thailand in the 1970s and encouraged schools, police, army and civil service to play. Today pétanque is mandatory in Thai military training, and the country belongs to the world elite along with Vietnam and Laos.</p>
            
            <p>Boule manufacturer FBT in Bangkok is one of few factories producing FIPJP-approved balls outside France, showing how deeply the sport has taken root.</p>

            <h3>Informal Traditions and Etiquette</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>"Faire fanny"</h4>
                <p>Losing 0–13 is called "faire fanny". In some clubs it's tradition that the team making fanny buys opponents a drink or, according to old French custom, kisses a wooden statue depicting Fanny. It's of course a playful ritual showing how social the game is.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h4>Good Etiquette Means:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Not walking in front of the player throwing</li>
                <li>Standing still and quiet when someone is concentrating</li>
                <li>Waiting to congratulate or comment until the ball has landed</li>
                <li>Using approved instruments for measuring (not feet)</li>
                <li>Showing respect to opponents, audience and referees</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>By combining official rule knowledge with good etiquette, you become an appreciated player wherever you throw your balls.</p>
