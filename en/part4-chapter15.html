            <h2>Introduction – The Coach's Role in Boule Pétanque</h2>
            <p>Leading a Boule Pétanque team is about balancing strategy and human understanding. A good coach is not just a tactician – but also a motivator, psychologist, and team builder. It's about seeing both the big picture and the individual, creating safety and courage, and making wise decisions when it matters most.</p>
            
            <p>In this chapter, we delve into how you as a coach:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>choose the right players for the right occasion,</li>
                <li>prepare the team for competitive play,</li>
                <li>handle pressure and setbacks,</li>
                <li>and build a culture where development and team spirit go hand in hand.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Before Competition – Strategic Considerations</h2>
            <p>Facing strong opposition requires more than just technique. It's about understanding the context: form, opponents, weather, and team dynamics.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Central Questions:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>How is the players' form and mental readiness?</li>
                    <li>Which combinations work best in the team?</li>
                    <li>How does the terrain character affect tactical choices?</li>
                    <li>What weighs heaviest in team selection – experience, form, or mental strength?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>🎯 Reflection:</strong></p>
                <p>An experienced coach knows that sometimes the most focused player is more important than the most technical one.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Team Selection – Finding the Right Balance</h2>
            <p>Team selection is an art form that weighs knowledge, intuition, and team chemistry. The goal is to create a team where everyone feels confidence in both coach and teammates.</p>
            
            <h3>Factors to Consider:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Experience and skills:</strong> past performance, technique, game understanding.</li>
                <li><strong>Mental strength:</strong> self-confidence, ability to handle pressure, focus.</li>
                <li><strong>Social ability:</strong> communication, willingness to cooperate, group dynamics.</li>
                <li><strong>Form:</strong> current training level, determination, development curve.</li>
                <li><strong>Role understanding:</strong> does the player accept their role – leader, reserve, supporting role?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>📊 Tip:</strong></p>
                <p>Create a simple team selection table where you assign points (1–5) for each factor. This makes the selection more thoughtful and open to reflection.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>During Competition – Real-time Coaching</h2>
            <p>When the match is underway, the coach's role transforms from planner to conductor. Your decisions affect not just the game – but also the team's emotional state.</p>
            
            <h3>Important Aspects:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Adapt tactics to weather conditions (rain, wind, terrain).</li>
                <li>Recognize pressure points – e.g., at 12–12 in the final end.</li>
                <li>Be clear in communication, but maintain calm.</li>
                <li>Keep focus on process, not just results.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>🧠 Coach's Mindset:</strong></p>
                <p><em>"A team that feels safe under pressure plays with clarity – not panic."</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Morale and Cooperation – When Things Go Wrong</h2>
            <p>Mistakes happen in every match. It's the coach's response that determines how the team recovers.</p>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Scenario:</h4>
                <p>A player misses a throw and becomes frustrated. Opponents celebrate, morale drops.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The coach's task becomes to:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>calm the player,</li>
                    <li>restore the team's focus,</li>
                    <li>turn frustration into concentration.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>💬 Reflection:</strong></p>
                <p>A conversation, a smile, or just a calm "it's okay" can be the difference between loss and turnaround.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Building a Team</h2>
            <p>Going from individuals to a functioning team requires work and time.</p>
            
            <h3>Cornerstones of Team Building:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Common goals:</strong> What do we want to achieve together?</li>
                <li><strong>Role distribution:</strong> Everyone knows their task and accepts it.</li>
                <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Open, honest and respectful dialogue.</li>
                <li><strong>Team building:</strong> Activities outside the terrain strengthen relationships.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>🤝 Reflection:</strong></p>
                <p>A team with clear goals and strong communication survives even setbacks.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Team Building at Distance</h2>
            <p>In a time when players may live in different locations, digital community is crucial.</p>
            
            <h3>Examples:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Video meetings for tactics, analysis and discussion.</li>
                <li>Joint online training sessions via Facebook or Teams.</li>
                <li>Shared goals and training results.</li>
                <li>Social activities – quizzes, conversations, analyses.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>💡 Coach's Lesson:</strong></p>
                <p>Distance doesn't have to mean lack of togetherness – just new ways to create it.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Creating a Good Training Environment</h2>
            <p>Training is the place where the team is formed. It's here that safety, discipline and motivation grow.</p>
            
            <h3>Keys to a Positive Environment:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Safety and trust:</strong> players dare to fail and try new things.</li>
                <li><strong>Clear structure:</strong> planned training sessions with goals and feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Individual development:</strong> customized exercises according to needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Variation:</strong> different environments and playing styles.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>🏗️ Reflection:</strong></p>
                <p>The best training environment is where laughter and focus coexist on the same terrain.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Coaching in Boule Pétanque is leadership built on balance. It requires seeing the person behind the boule.</p>
