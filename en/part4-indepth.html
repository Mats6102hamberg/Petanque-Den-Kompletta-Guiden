            <p class="quote">Mastering pétanque is a lifelong journey. The rules provide the framework, but it is strategy, psychology, and training habits that determine how far you go.</p>

            <h2 id="strategy">Chapter 11: Strategic Analysis and Tactics</h2>
            <p>The rules explain how you are allowed to play; strategy determines how you should play to win. Developing a conscious and structured strategy helps you make better decisions, especially under pressure.</p>

            <h3>Basic Strategies</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Read the surface before throwing.</strong> Observe whether the ground is hard, soft, sandy, or rocky, as this will influence how the boule behaves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Choose the right boule for your style.</strong> Material, weight, and diameter all affect control, precision, and stability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Place the first boule in front of the jack.</strong> Positioning the first boule 30–50 cm in front of the jack helps create a defensive "wall."</li>
                    <li><strong>Play on your opponents' weaknesses.</strong> Carefully observe how they throw and adapt your game accordingly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be flexible.</strong> Test different tactics depending on the situation instead of sticking rigidly to one approach.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Advanced Tactics</h3>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Tactic</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Multi-step terrain analysis</strong></td>
                    <td>Think several throws ahead. Identify stones, slopes, or obstacles that could serve as support points or barriers.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Position the jack intentionally</strong></td>
                    <td>Place the jack on a part of the terrain that favors your team more than your opponents.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Change tempo</strong></td>
                    <td>Alternate between fast, decisive throws and slow, controlled ones to disrupt rhythm.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Make the opponent think</strong></td>
                    <td>Use difficult placements or long throws to push them out of their comfort zone.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <h2 id="mental">Chapter 12: Mental Strength and Focus</h2>
            <p>The difference between good and excellent players often lies in mental strength rather than technique alone. The mind can — and should — be trained just like your throwing skills.</p>

            <h3>Handling Pressure — Three Techniques</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Breathing and visualization</h4>
                <p>Slow, deep breathing combined with visualizing a successful throw helps reduce anxiety.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 15px;">Positive mindset</h4>
                <p>A confident and optimistic attitude makes it easier to stay focused under stress.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 15px;">Personal routines</h4>
                <p>Develop a consistent pre-throw routine to create calm and consistency.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Mental Checklist Before Every Throw</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>Run through the following steps mentally:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stance</strong> – Are you balanced?</li>
                    <li><strong>Grip</strong> – Is your hold steady and relaxed?</li>
                    <li><strong>Angle</strong> – Is your arm positioned correctly?</li>
                    <li><strong>Length</strong> – Have you judged the distance properly?</li>
                    <li><strong>Lean</strong> – Are you compensating for any slope in the terrain?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Additional Mental Techniques</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Backward visualization:</strong> Imagine the boule traveling backwards from the jack to your hand — a technique that sharpens your sense of trajectory.</li>
                <li><strong>Learn from each other:</strong> Discuss throws with teammates to gain new perspectives.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Focus and Concentration</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid distractions by staying aware of all boules on the court.</li>
                    <li>Develop a personal ritual before every throw.</li>
                    <li>Regular meditation can significantly improve focus.</li>
                    <li>Use mental imagery — picture the throw clearly before executing it.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Motivation and Goal Setting</h3>
            <p>Set goals that guide your training:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Short-term goals:</strong> Hit a specific target ten times per session.</li>
                <li><strong>Medium-term goals:</strong> Improve your accuracy over a season.</li>
                <li><strong>Long-term goals:</strong> Win a tournament.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Clear goals give both direction and motivation.</p>

            <h2 id="training">Chapter 13: Training Plan and Development</h2>
            <p>Improvement is not just about playing more — it is about training smarter. Effective training saves time and leads to better results.</p>

            <h3>Five Principles of Effective Training</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Play regularly.</strong> Three well-planned sessions per week are usually sufficient.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vary opponents.</strong> Play against different styles and participate in tournaments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Train with experienced players.</strong> Learn from those who have mastered technique and strategy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Practice deliberately.</strong> Focus on one specific skill at a time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alternate technique and free play.</strong> Analyze during training, but trust your instinct during matches.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h3>Analysis and Self-Assessment</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Continuous learning:</strong> Document every training session and match.</li>
                <li><strong>Video analysis:</strong> Film your throws and review your technique.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance profile:</strong> Create a matrix of your psychological, tactical, technical, and physical skills.</li>
            </ul>

                <h4>Training Tip</h4>
                <p>Perform exercises with light weights or with the pétanque boule itself, using high repetitions to build the low-intensity endurance required in long matches.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 id="physical">Chapter 14: Conclusion</h2>
            <p>By analyzing the terrain, choosing the right tactics, training purposefully, and strengthening your mental game, you take control of both your performance and your development.</p>

            <p>And remember — enjoyment is essential. The social interaction and joy of pétanque are just as important as winning.</p>
